<p align="left"><font size="4">A general members meeting was held at the
Pembroke Police Services building in Pembroke on March 31, 2004. This meeting is
part of an ongoing build that the Renfrew County ARES group is currently working
on. It followed an email blitz that took place in the previous month that saw
every amateur in the County of Renfrew (where possible) receive an email
inviting them to learn more about ARES. There were
<a href="http://www.rcarc.ca/Meetings/31MAR04ATT.htm">21 members</a>
in attendance, several of which were new members.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Following introductions and a general business
session, the group then began the Needs and Assessment portion of the meeting.
The concept here is to raise awareness of the many questions that we may harbor
as individuals but have not brought forward. It is the intention of this meeting
to raise questions specific to our role as ARES members. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The segment was kicked off with this introductory
speech presented by the EC.</font></p>
<hr>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Prestige12 BT" size="4">&quot;Joining the thrust
of the ARES groups throughout Ontario, Renfrew County ARES and the amateurs of
Renfrew County are in many ways leading the Province with the ability to respond
to the needs of our community. This has been demonstrated in various fashions.
Certainly one of the most obvious is the work done by the amateurs in
conjunction with the Chalk River Region Nuclear Emergency Plan Exercise. This,
along with the Search and Rescue abilities of our group is the envy of more than
a few ARES groups province wide. Our agreement with the County of Renfrew has
been the model several municipalities have and are using to fashion their own
agreements with our organization. Recognition by our local police services as
well as the OPP along with the aforementioned agreements and OSARVA training has
resulted in Renfrew County ARES members becoming a vital link in the communities
Emergency Plan.&quot;</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Prestige12 BT">&nbsp;<font size="4">&quot;I believe
that in order to continue to meet the obligations we have set for ourselves, we
need to look very hard and very seriously at our ARES group. I have often used
the ice-storm as a reference when talking about our abilities. We, as amateurs
opened the eyes of the community leaders, in fact, in most cases, we surprised
them to the degree that we were given letters of recognition, awards of merit,
and in a lot of cases, recognition from the Premier of the Province. But the
truth is, we surprised them.&quot;</font></font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Prestige12 BT">
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;&quot;We as ARES members no longer
have the element of surprise on our side. Our elected officials are now looking
at us closely and have certain expectations of ARES. Moreover, the local
municipalities that are counting on ARES, specifically within the Renfrew
County, have certain expectations&nbsp;of ARES. This brings me to the next point. Are
the members of Renfrew County Amateur Radio Emergency Services ready?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Prestige12 BT">
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;&quot;I think the answer to the
above is more complex than just a yes or no. I strongly believe that we are a
lot more ready than we were during the ice storm. I also believe that if we were
called upon tomorrow to provide our services for a municipal state of emergency,
we would have a tough time meeting the expectations of our community. This is
the matter at hand, the one I wish to address at this meeting. Renfrew
County&nbsp;amateur radio operators are some of the finest of the finest. Renfrew
County is an extremely large county, with numerous municipalities, and numerous
elected officials, and numerous potential hazards. This makes for a challenge
for any EC. If there is any light at the end of the tunnel, it is in the
resources that our local&nbsp;amateur&nbsp;radio operators offer. All of the resources in
the world however, does not solve all of the problems all of the time. The best
we can hope for is to meet realistic expectations from those who count on us. In
order to do this task, those resources require good management. When I review
our obligation to the community, it becomes apparent that mere existence is no
longer an acceptable answer. Add to that the recent growth of interest in ARES
from our friends in Arnprior, Renfrew, Horton and Greater Madawaska, and it
becomes real clear that effective management is no longer just one meeting a
year, but rather a complete re-assessment of our local group.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Prestige12 BT">
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;&quot;Many of you here tonight are
aware that there has been a significant ‘behind the scenes’ effort to kick start
the year for ARES by initiating contact with all amateurs in the County where
possible, and inviting them to learn more about ARES. Many of you here tonight
have been involved with ARES for a number of years, and some of you are here for
the first time. In our continued effort to build our group to a state of
readiness, I hope with your help to complete a needs and assessment of the
Renfrew County ARES group.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Prestige12 BT">
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-weight: 700">&nbsp;&quot;To this end I have prepared
a list of questions that are open for discussion amongst one another. The
results of which when compiled will reflect many of our strengths and our
weaknesses.&nbsp; I do not expect nor do I anticipate to be able to solve many of the
issues at hand tonight, however, if we can establish the areas that clearly need
attention, than this meeting will have served its purpose. A follow up meeting
is scheduled for the end of May, at which time I would hope to see some resolve
to the issues we identify tonight.&quot;</span></font></p>
