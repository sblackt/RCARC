<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">With several winter months still ahead of us here in the
Valley, ARES Assistant EC John (VA3AJT) took it upon himself to contact Fred
(VA3FPB) and organize a winter training exercise for the Renfrew County Amateur
Radio Emergency Services group. <img border="0" src="http://www.rcarc.ca/ARESPics/2001Chalet/infrontofchalet.jpg" align="right" width="640" height="480"></font></p>
<p><font size="4">The exercise would entail the group spending a day at a
beautiful cabin donated for the cause by friends. We would first group at the
entrance to a bush road just off the main highway. From this point, using snow
mobiles and 4-wheel drive vehicles, some of&nbsp; the party would be ferried to
the cabin, while others would either snow-shoe or cross country ski&nbsp; some 4
kilometers into the bush along a very picturesque bush road to arrive at a
winter oasis. The cabin, or as I like to call it, Chalet, was right out of a
picture book. Even the outdoor amenities had a woodstove, that John had already
heated upon his arrival the night before. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">It was'nt very long, and our Search and Rescue instructor put
us to work.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here is the story as told by ARES members Ron Davies VE3ZRV
and Brodie Doyle VA3BDT.</font> </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">A very sunny day, temperature -24<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">°</span>
C. Grid coordinates 165 712 on the Pembroke map 31 F/14.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Location was VA3AJT’s cottage highway 62, Alice Fraser
Townships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A very big thank you
goes to John from all who attended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Members
in attendance were John VA3AJT, Anthony VE3AJH, Fred VA3FPB, Brodie VA3BDT, Bob
VE3GQW, Yvonne VE3RYA, Les VE3PL, Randy VA3RKS, Jamie VA3JRC and Ron VE3ZRV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Members began the day at 0900 with the 4-Km hike come snowmobile ride in
to the location.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As soon as
we arrived we proceeded to pile snow under the watchful eye of Fred VA3FPB. This
exercise was performed immediately for two reasons first to complete the hard
work of shoveling while we were all fresh and keen, and secondly to allow the
snow time to settle for the rest of the morning before we attempted to construct
our Quinzee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="http://www.rcarc.ca/ARESPics/2001Chalet/Freddigging.jpg" align="right" width="398" height="301"></span><u>Please
note</u>- this is the first time we had the privilege of seeing Les with a
shovel in his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next
exercise was gathering firewood for lunch, during which Fred enlightened us on
how much energy your body uses to convert snow into water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it turns out, it’s pretty much useless to eat snow if you’re
thirsty and dehydrated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As you can see, there isn’t a shortage of volunteers when it comes to
making the fire and preparing lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fred
did us proud with the good old Canadian stand-by, soup and hot dogs over easy.
“ Oh how sweet it is!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A good hearty lunch provided by ARES topped off with a granola bar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thank you Fred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next
the members were divided into three groups. Each group set out on a short
triangular course taking GPS and compass readings for each leg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The GPS/compass exercise was designed to show members how accurate the
GPS is now that the scramblers are shut off. I must admit it’s mighty
impressive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next exercise was
one of Fred’s scavenger hunts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>OK guys. Go find some Spruce, Red Pine, White Pine, and some
Balsam Fir. Oh yes, I nearly forgot. Also find some rabbit droppings and I’ll
add an extra bonus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Interest
Tip:</u><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you make your bed with
spruce boughs, you will have a very uncomfortable night. If you make your bed
with balsam fir you will sleep like a baby. (That’s what Fred told us.)<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a very successful hunt<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(less the rabbit droppings), it was time to discuss some knots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fred and Les demonstrated the Bowline, the Truckers knot and the
Fisherman’s knot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A lively
discussion about their usage followed.</p>

<img border="0" src="http://www.rcarc.ca/ARESPics/2001Chalet/Randydigging.jpg" align="left" width="371" height="279">It
was then time to finish off our Quinzee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
snow that was piled earlier in the day was allowed to sinter for a few hours in
the sun in order to make a sturdy and compact structure without melting.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The snow pile was approximately 18 feet across and
roughly 5 feet in height.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
prevent digging too close to the ceiling of the shelter, a number of ‘gauge
sticks’ were placed into the snow pile before hollowing out the living
quarters. These sticks allowed us to keep a uniform thickness throughout the
entire structure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The gauge sticks
were approximately 12 inches long and were no thicker than a pencil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Another <u>point of interest</u>: Les was once again seen with a shovel
in his hand and digging like a gopher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
the Quinzee was hollowed out, all members took turns inside, I must admit it was
very quiet in there, even John was able to enter after the door was slightly
modified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The shelter is very
practical and comfortable. However, it was noted that it was extremely
soundproof.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you were waiting to
be rescued and searchers were calling your name, chances are you would not hear
them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you were yelling and
whistling for help you would not be heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One thing should be noted; the radio had no problem working from inside
the Quinzee. </p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Unfortunately our day had come to an end so we finished
off inside the warmth of the cabin with Fred conducting a debriefing session,
going over most of the points covered during the day’s activities, along with
a hot cup of chocolate. Everybody was a little sad to leave but just like the
old saying, “All good things must come to an end” A great time was had by
all thanks to John and Fred.</p>
