<p align="left"><font size="4">The Renfrew County ARES EC was approached by
organizing committee member Lynne Langton and asked if ARES would offer their
services to assist with an upcoming event scheduled for Saturday September
25/04. The concept of the event was to host a walk and bike tour in the
Whitewater district with pledges and donations to go to the Whitewater Bromley
Community Health Centre Project Programs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">A meeting was scheduled, in which the ARES EC for
Renfrew County attended, and the details were discussed in greater depth. It was
decided that the ARES group would assist with the bike tour in a manner of
patrol, and to relay communications back to St. John ambulance if required as
well as to report on the progress of the bikes. The ambulance would be parked at
the fair grounds, and a command post would be set up and run by an ARES member.
A request then was sent out to the general membership for those that wanted to
participate in this ARES exercise.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Saturday morning saw several ARES members
assemble at the Beachburg Fair grounds. In attendance was Jamie (VA3JRC), George
(VE3GPD), Les (VE3PL), Chris (VE3BOY), and Val (VE3UEW). The members were given
a map of the bike route, and positioned themselves along the route as required.
The day itself was a very nice day, with a mild breeze and fair temperatures.
The event concluded with a BBQ in which those members of ARES that participated
were invited to indulge. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The organizing committee was very pleased with
the capabilities of the ARES group, and made a small donation to the ARES bank
account to help fund other ARES initiatives. This donation was received with
gratitude, and a thank you was delivered verbally to the organization group,
followed by a letter of thanks.</font></p>
