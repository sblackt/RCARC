July 27/03</font></p>

20:45 hours EST</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Reason:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Lost male in
bush for at least 7 days.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Briefing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> OPP ERT
members have been on site for several days. Radio communications between OPP ERT
members have been poor due to local terrain.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Action:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Requested ARES
members be on-site at 0830 hrs the following morning. Six members depart from
Pembroke and area in two vehicles. Immediately upon arriving, ARES members begin
the task of setting up a temporary antenna system, complete with battery power
for base radio communications. The base radio will be set up&nbsp; in the OPP
trailer. By 0845, base radio is activated and members are briefed by OPP ERT
Incident Commander. Les will operate the radio at base camp and liason with the
OPP ERT members. At 0900 Fred departs into the bush, and at 0915, John&nbsp; and
Jamie are off by assignment to cover a given area. Clinton is next to have an
assignment, and also heads off in a given direction. Greg is teamed with the K9
unit, and is tasked out. This is intended to be an all out effort to find the
missing person today, due to the length of time of exposure, and based on his
lack of bush experience, it is critical that he be found in the next 12 hours.
Due to heavy fog in the area, the OPP helicopter is delayed. It finally arrives
at approximately 1000 hours. At 1120 hours, all SAR members asked to stay put,
while an OPP ERT member fires a round. Some members report what may have been
yelling following the shot. A second shot is fired, but nothing is heard
following the report. At 1240 hrs, members are asked to meet at specific
coordinates to allow for retrieval for lunch. Some members are too far in, and
will have luch delivered. By 1330 the search is back under full steam, and by
1338 team 3 is tasked with a detailed search in a given find area. What appears
to be the casualty's&nbsp; boots have been discovered within a swampy area.
7431&nbsp; 8580 are the given coordinates for the found boots. This relates to
the Bancroft map NAD83. A detailed contour search is executed in the immediate
area of the find. At 1430 team 3 reports in that they have found the casualty,
alive and relatively well. Extrication from the site will take approximately 45
minutes to reach an area where the casualty can be picked up by OPP four-wheeler
and brought out to a road where he can be transported back to base camp. His
family is notified and brought by OPP to the base camp. Team 3 reports that he
will require pants and socks, these are supplied him by one of our ARES members.
At 1526 hours, the casualty is returned to base camp, and after a brief reunion
with his mother, he is transported by ambulance to a local hospital for minor
medical treatment.</font></p>
