in the Rockcliffe Park area of Ottawa.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Briefing:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Ardeth Wood, a 27
year old female cyclist, missing since Wednesday, August 06/03. ARES members to
assist OPP and other agencies in search efforts for Ardeth. Search to focus on
specific areas of the Rockcliffe park section of the bicycle path back to the
banks of Greens Creek. Search members to form a line, and using a grid
technique, will search for evidence of missing person. ARES members asked to be
on scene for Sunday, Aug.10/03 at 0800.<b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Action: </b>Following a phone call from
Special Constable Peter Graves of the OPP to the Renfrew County ARES Emergency Coordinator,
VE3PL (Les Thom)&nbsp; requesting assistance of ARES members that had received
<a href="http://www.etown.net/northshoresearch/OSARVA.htm">OSARVA</a> training
and certification,
Fred (VA3FPB) ARES search coordinator was contacted. Through discussion with
Les and Fred it was decided that a number of available ARES members would
travel to Ottawa early Sunday morning (Aug.10/03) and engage in the search. Upon
arrival. Fred contacted the on-scene commander and solicited directions for our
group. Because our group members had received OSARVA training, we were permitted
into the inner circle of searchers who would work directly with the police
agencies on scene. After a briefing from the incident commander, our group was
divided up and sent out under the leadership of the OPP ERT (Emergency Response
Team) members. The weather
was cloudy with slight drizzle and at times heavy rain, making a selection of
outer wear important. The group I (VE3PL - Les Thom - Renfrew County ARES
Emergency Coordinator) was involved with traveled from the command
post by vehicle to an area along the bike path. Once we reached this location,
we prepared for a line search. Our search would take us in line pattern through
mixed underbrush, to heavy underbrush from the bike path to the banks of Greens
Creek. Once the bank of the creek was reached, our group would then move the
line west by the length of the line, and start progressing back to the path. The
outer edge of the search line was being flagged by our members as required. At
one point, it became obvious that part of the area we were responsible for
searching had already been flagged. A call was put into command post, and it was
learned that some flagging had taken place during previous hasty searches,
however, we were to continue as planned. Searching continued until just after 1
o'clock, at which time our line was once again out at the bicycle path. We then
received orders to return to command post and await lunch. Most of us removed
our wet clothing, socks included while waiting for a bite to eat. Lunch was
served via a buffet style, utilizing a city OC Transpo bus as a walk through.
Following lunch, and while preparing to return to the search, word was handed
down that all search activity would be halted until some new evidence was
checked in further detail. It was stated that this could take several hours. Upon discussion with
Peter Graves of the OPP, it was mutually decided that our group should consider
returning to Pembroke. After a few handshakes and pictures, we were back on the
road home. It was decided while en-route to meet at Jamie's QTH for a warm
coffee and a de-briefing.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Results:</b> It was the following day we
learned the fate of Ardeth Wood. Following the discovery of her black Peugeot
hybrid bicycle, closer searches of the immediate area resulted in police divers
locating a body. After positive identification, and an autopsy, it was learned
that Ardeth had become a murder victim. On behalf of the Renfrew County Amateur
Radio Emergency Services group, I extend our greatest condolences to family and
loved ones of Ardeth Wood. Police have since distributed a composite drawing of
a suspect in the murder of Ardeth Wood. Further information on the on-going
investigation can be located on the internet.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Debriefing:</b> Following a formal thank you
by the OPP our members left the site and returned by vehicle to Pembroke. It was
decided to hold a debriefing at Jamies' QTH. Some of the matters discussed was
the likelihood of the outcome. It was also noted that this search effort by our
members was different than others in the sense that we were not there to supplement
communications, as we have been called on to do in the past. Communications was
not a problem with in the city area, and our services were utilized as OSARVA
trained searchers. Mention was made of the fact that at some points during the
search in particular search groups, there appeared to be a conflict of
leadership between the OPP ERT members and the local Ottawa Police. It was
stated that the search was in fact under command of the Ottawa Police Chief
(Vince Beven) and the OPP were assisting with their expertise in search
techniques. It was mutually agreed that our members all performed the tasks
requested of them in a professional manner. </font></p>
