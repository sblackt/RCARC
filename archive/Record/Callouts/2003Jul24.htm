<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Briefing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> Female
(Deloris) 113 lbs 5'2&quot; 38 years of age last seen the previous evening
wearing white running shoes, white T-Shirt and shorts and a gold with silver
watch.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Action:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Renfrew County
Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) Search Coordinator VA3FPB alerts Renfrew
County ARES EC (Emergency Coordinator) VE3PL at 1822 hours EST that he had been
contacted by on-scene commander Peter Graves of the OPP, who has requested the
assistance of the Renfrew County ARES group. Upon the ARES EC receiving the
above information, it was mutually agreed by both coordinators to immediately
activate the call-out tree, and to also place a call on the local repeater
VE3NRR to net any ARES members that may be on frequency. A tentative on air net
is set for VE3NRR at 1845 hours for a briefing of the situation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Results: </b>Following the implementation of
the call out tree and the on air requests for ARES members, a dozen Renfrew
County ARES members are present on the local repeater for further instructions.
At this time, the Renfrew County ARES Search Coordinator briefs all members,
indicates that this will be a night search. The weather is reported as mild with
very wet conditions and a very good chance of rain. Visibility is poor due to
the heavy cloud cover. Directions are given to the Golden Lake Fire Hall where
our members are to meet at 2030 hours. Preparations are made to include a base
communications system should the time and terrain dictate the requirement for
greater range communications. This package will include a stand-up 30' tower
with a Ringo-Ranger antenna, a 32 amp power supply, and a 50 watt 2-meter mobile
unit with some deep cycle back-up battery power should we loose power due to
weather conditions. Upon arrival on scene, the ARES EC was informed by Incident
Command that due to an immediate turn of events, the lost person may have been
found. As this was being checked out by the OPP, ARES members that were still
en-route were radioed to hold their position until further notified. With-in
minutes, the OPP confirmed that the missing person had been positively
identified, and she would be receiving medical attention for minor concerns. All
participating ARES members at this time were notified of the situation, and it
was decided that those that were interested could meet at the home QTH of VA3FPB
for a de-brief and a social gathering.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Debriefing: </b>Following a formal thank you
by the OPP for our participation, several members met at the home QTH of VA3FPB
to discuss various issues resulting from the call-out. All members present felt
that the call-out as a whole was very well handled. Some members expressed the
need to better prepare for the unexpected call-out when it occurs. It was also
mentioned that the call-out tree needs to be updated and possibly password
protected and made available to members via the web page. Several members
compared some of their personnel equipment and discussed items for the ready
bag.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Members: </b>The following members were
