<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Briefing: A call was placed to the Renfrew
County ARES Search Coordinator, Fred (VA3FPB), by OPP Special Constable ERT
member Peter Graves, who in turn alerted Bob (VE3GQW)
and the Renfrew County ARES EC, Les (VE3PL). At this point in time it was
established that a 67 year old senior citizen was missing in the Black Bay road area of the
County. The casualty was reported to have been out overnight, after not
returning from cutting wood on his wood lot. A search was underway and ARES members were
asked to  be on scene by 0900.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Action: The ARES telephone tree was activated
while Fred proceeded to the search site. There was no command post set up, and
no structure that could be used as a command post at this point. Tarps were
being considered for shelter because a a steady rain that was descending on the
area. The temperature was around 7 degrees C at this point, but had been much
lower (approx. 0 degrees C) overnight. Contacting ARES members was difficult do
to the fact that this was a work day, and many of the members were either
en-route to work, or not yet at their respective work locations. A number of
ARES members were contacted and instructions were given to them to report to
VE3NRR for a update from Fred. A reminder was passed to each member to dress for
the weather. </b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Results: After arriving on scene, Fred was
notified that a casualty had been located, and a positive identification was in
the process of being made. Fred then alerted all ARES members to hold their
position until the results of the identification process was completed. Once it
was confirmed that the located person was in fact the casualty (he had  wandered out onto a road and was
pick up by a member of the Ontario Police) and identity was confirmed, ARES
members were told to stand down.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Debriefing: ARES members were thanked for
being available, and Special Constable Peter Graves of the OPP made a short
thank you speech via the VE3NRR repeater to those ARES members that were
involved. Aside from a rather smooth operation, some updates were made to the
call out tree.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4"><b>Members: </b>The following members were
directly&nbsp; or indirectly involved. This list is in no particular order and
