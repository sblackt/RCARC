      <td width="446" height="345">Through the combined efforts of Assistant
        Emergency Coordinator John terHuurne (VA3AJT)&nbsp; and&nbsp; Renfrew County ARES Search and Rescue Coordinator Fred Blackstein
        (VA3FPB),&nbsp; members of the Renfrew County ARES group had the
        opportunity to get the bottoms of their canoe wet with a leisurely 15
        kilometer paddle down the Snake River. The group initially met at the
        bottom of Meath Hill, just east of Pembroke, and from there activated a
        plan that would see the vehicle of Les Thom (VE3PL) being left at the
        pick-up point, which conveniently turned out to be at the property of
        Lewis Lambert (VA3KKO) and though Lewis was in absenteeism, his generous
        offer of his property fit well into the plan. Meanwhile the rest of the
        vehicles were stationed at the 'Put-In' point further east. As the group
        unloaded their canoes and belongings, Randy Smith (VA3RKS) snapped some
        pictures 'For The Record', so you can follow along the route with our
        group.

        <p>As the group got underway, many of us commented on just how beautiful
        a day our organizers were able to produce for just this event. Tony
        Hinds (VA3HWH) teamed up with his partner (see below) and we were off.</p>

        <p>As can be seen on the left Randy has managed to capture Les giving
        Fred a few last minute tips on paddling technique.... But more likely,
        Fred is instructing Les on the difference between the top and the bottom
        of the canoe. The group pushed off without too much splashing, and every
        one looked forward to the opportunity to take in some of the spectacular
        sights.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>I think John and Catherine were still on shore debating about which
        end of the canoe is front and which is the back. As the entourage
        drifted down river, Randy gives us an inside view of the day. Enjoy the
        pictures, and by all means, try to get signed up for an ARES outing, it
        will be one worth remembering. </p>

        <p>Finally, lunch was served on the banks of the Snake River. Every one
        had brought along a great lunch, but none of us had the gourmet meal
        that John kept to himself.... what was that John? Peanut Butter?? </td>
