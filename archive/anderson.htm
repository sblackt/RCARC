<p align="left"><font size="4">In an attempt to meet the requirements of
interoperability and still meet the demand of keeping expenses well with in the
realm of the average amateur, Renfrew County ARES has accepted the
proposition by OTTAWA ARES/EMRG group to use the Anderson Power Pole
Connectors. Along with their high current handling capacity (30 Amps) and ease
of use, they are packaged in a very rugged and well colour coded neoprene type
enclosure. They take wire from number 16 to 12 which can be crimped or soldered
to the connector. The connectors can be fastened together&nbsp;either
horizontally or vertically&nbsp;by a tongue and groove system.&nbsp; Roll pins
are available to lock the connectors together as are "block locks"
which connect up to 4 pairs as a bulk head connector. There are 11 colours in
the series allowing for use in signal cable applications also. For a closer look
at the <a href="http://www.andersonpower.com/">Anderson Power Pole</a> connector,
you can click on the link and follow the prompts.&nbsp; Look for Single Pole
Connector Series and search out catalogue number 1330 (Red) and number 1330G4
(Black). There are full specs, drawings and a list of accessories.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">The connectors are available through Renfrew
County ARES, and a single set (this includes 1 Black and 1 Red connector) sells
for $2.00. A quantity of 5 sets are bagged and sell for $9.00. A quantity order
of 50 to 99 sets sell for $1.50 per set and quantities over 100 sell for $1.25
per set.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">You should note that your purchase not only
allows you to have the required connecters to quickly change radios, power
sources, etc., but also you </font><font size="4">will be putting approximately
anywhere from $0.13 per set to $0.88 per set (depending on quantity of order)
directly into the <font color="#ff0000">Renfrew County ARES bank account </font>to
help offset costs of some of our programs. To place an order, request more information,
