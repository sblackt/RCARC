<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">"During Sarscene 97, OSARVA,
Ontario Search and Rescue Volunteer Association was formed. This organization is
split into six regions, these regions have the same boundaries as the OPP
regions.</font> <font face="Arial" size="3">All volunteer SAR organizations in
Ontario should become a member of this organization, each SAR group who joins
this organization will be trained to OPP standards and will be given certificates
stated that you have passed the standards set by the OPP. This certificate will
allow you to join in a search anywhere in Ontario and possibly Canada. If your
organization does not want to join this organization, OPP will not use your
organization to do searches."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Formed in 1997, the Ontario SAR
Volunteer Association, OSARVA, is working diligently to represent the numerous
volunteer groups which exist in Ontario. Ontario government regulations require
that any civilian participating in a search in this province must have a valid,
current OSARVA certification.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p align="left">Approximately 20 members of the Renfrew County Amateur Radio
Emergency Services attended training and obtained certification by the Ontario
Provincial Police in Petawawa Ontario during the period of December 3'rd,4'th,
and 5'th, 1999. Since it's inception, OSARVA has undergone several significant
changes and during a an annual meeting held April 12'th and 13'th,
2003, in Orillia at OPP headquarters and attended by an ARES Renfrew County representative,
some of the most significant advancements in the OSARVA group have come to
light. This has included amongst other things a change in some of the leadership
rolls, as well as a revised set of OSARVA bylaws. (<i>Which we hope to see
published on the <a href="http://osarva.nt.net/">OSARVA
web site</a>.)</i></p>
<p align="left">The Renfrew County ARES group maintained a membership with
OSARVA for many years, but with an increase in the annual fees, and the
increasing age of our ARES members, it was decided to drop our membership at the
beginning of 2006.</p>
<p align="left">Under the umbrella of OSARVA, the Renfrew County ARES group have
been activated a number of times by the OPP ERT (<i>Emergency Response Team</i>)
to assist in Search and Rescue attempts in and around our region. Our efforts
were met with great respect and those sentiments were reflected by the Senior
OPP officer in charge on several occasions. Not only were our people trained and
prepared to join in a search and rescue but we as ARES members provided the much
needed communications to cover the distance and terrain of the search. A most
instances, a radio control center was set up in the OPP command post 5'th wheel
trailer, and our OSARVA trained ARES personnel were distributed amongst the OPP
search teams to provide the communications link back to the command post. This challenge
was met, and in most OPP ERT&nbsp; members words, it far exceeded the
expectations of the OPP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
