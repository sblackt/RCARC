<p style="font-family: Verdana;" align="left"><b><font size="4">The County of Renfrew stretches from the
national capital region of Ottawa to the west, along the shores of the beautiful
Ottawa River to the northern tip of historic Algonquin Park. Renfrew County is
the largest County in Ontario with over 300 pristine lakes and four major river
systems.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana;"><b><font size="4">R</font><font size="4">enfrew County
Amateur Radio Emergency Services </font></b><font size="4">is challenged
with the task of providing emergency communications when required to protect
life and property within Renfrew County. Members of the Renfrew County ARES
group include some of the best trained communicators in the province of Ontario,
and very possibly far beyond the provincial boundaries. Our group has had
extensive training in emergency communications, and several of our members have
played significant roles in severe circumstances, such as maintaining
communication posts during the great 'Ice Storm, assisting the Ontario
Provincial Police Emergency Response Team with trained search and rescue
personnel (see <a href="http://www.rcarc.ca/osarva.htm">OSARVA</a>)
as well as contributing vital radio communication links in vast woodland areas.</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana;" align="left"><font size="4">To further entrench our services
within the county, several signed agreements have been written such as the '<i><a href="http://www.countyofrenfrew.on.ca/EmergencyServices/Emergency%20Plan/Part%201%20-%20Annex%20A%20-%20Appendix%204.pdf">Agreement
between the County of Renfrew&nbsp; and the Amateur Radio Emergency Services
(ARES) for Renfrew County,</a>&nbsp;</i> the <i>'Amateur Radio&nbsp; Emergency
Services Pembroke Police Service</i>&nbsp; <i>Protocol</i>,&nbsp; and also the <i>Amateur&nbsp;
Radio Emergency Services Ontario Provincial Police Protocol Upper Ottawa Valley
Detachment and Killaloe Detachment, </i>and our standing agreement with the <i>Canadian
Red Cross</i>. To compliment our agreements our members in conjunction with the
AECL Nuclear Emergency Response have installed a number of commercial antennas
for emergency communications on several structures in the County. These
buildings include the Renfrew County Building, the Red Cross building, the
Pembroke Fire Department building, Algonquin College Pembroke Campus, Pembroke
Police Service building, Fellows High School, Champlain Discovery Public School,
and Bishop Smith High School.&nbsp; In most cases, these sites include a ready box that is
equipped with a transceiver and other emergency communications equipment.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana;" align="left"><font size="4">During non-emergency community
functions, our members can often be spotted assisting organizers by supplying communications
for community activities ranging from parades, Pembroke Waterfront concert
activities, the annual Silver Spoon in Deep River, the International Triathlon
held for the first time ever in Whitewater Region, Pembroke and area 'Goblin
Patrol' and a score of other events that provide our members with the
opportunity to maintain our high degree of communication skills while assisting
our local friends and neighbors in the way we do best, by providing essential
amateur radio communications.</font></p>
