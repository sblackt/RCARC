<span style="font-weight: bold;">18-Oct-10 <big>-</big></span><big> &nbsp;<small>The web pages have been made with "Frontpage", "NVU", or "WORD" all of which add loads of "crap" into the program.

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">04-May '07</span> - Added a new page with links to the county emergency plan and the and municipal emergency plans that are available on the web.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">11 Dec '06</span> - There
were problems back in Oct. that caused the website to revert to it's
earlier (6 months ago) form. This has now been corrected, and the site
is back to being nearly current! Most of the links have been fixed,
however, I'm sure there are lots of broken links left to locate and
fix. Let me (VE3YX) know if you find any problems. &nbsp;There are
additions to the "scrapbook" page.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">18FEB06 - </font>New
website being modified by
Bob VE3YX. New URL: <a href="http://www.rcarc.ca">http://www.rcarc.ca</a>.
It will take a while to bash it into shape!! </p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">14FEB06 - </font>New
net control schedule posted
on the new website. </p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">18OCT05</font>
- Added a link in the navigation
window to a page on the ARES website that will be used to announce
current news
and items of interest to ARES members, and the Renfrew County ARES
group as a
whole. </p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">17OCT05</font>
- Updated the ARES net control
roster to reflect the net controllers up to the end of Jan/06.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">03OCT05</font>
- Added a link to the findu.com
site on the family page, and also added the pictures of our new
pleasure 'Knot @
Home'. </p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">29MAY05 </font>-
Removed the second web cam link
due to mostly non-activity. Now just running the single web-cam.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">24APR05</font>
- Fixed the link to the Renfrew
County ARES agreement between the County and ARES. Thanks Ed (VA3ED)
for
pointing out the break in the link. The County had moved the file, but
there is
now a new pointer to the new location.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">14APR05 </font>-
Fixed the link to OSARVA.
(Thanks to Brad VE3BSM for pointing out the problem)</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">23MAR05</font>
- Now have the new
updated (working) version of the cam software (VisionGS) and I am
running a continuous stream under a Beta test mode. This stream is set
to stream at 56K modem speed. (The cams are available only via the
Fester site) There is a second stream also running, and it is set as a
high speed video stream, though this stream is NOT 24/7, it will be
streaming most days. Also corrected the IP Upload database issue. Also
changed the hyperlink text background to draw more attention to the
navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">19FEB05 - </font>Finally
had the opportunity to
re-address the sound card issue with the scanner page. I am now once
again
running 2 separate sound sources into the feed. You might hear an HF
net from
your left speaker, and the VHF/UHF scanner on the right. Just use your
balance
control on your favorite player to select either (or both) channels. I
also
updated the scrolling script (on the Family page) to reflect the
changes on the
scanner page. </p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">25DEC04</font>
- Updated the link to the
Communications Interface page by Cint Hurd. Thank you Clint for the
information
and updated URL, as well as for maintaining a great page. Also
corrected the
'HOME tab on the digital page to open a whole page when returning to
Home from
the link at the bottom of the page.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">14DEC04</font>
- Updated the ARES Net Control
schedule. Also added new items to the ARES calendar.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">04NOV04</font>
- Added a direct link to the
listen mode of the scanner on the main menu page.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">03NOV04</font>
- Updated the link to ARESONTARIO
to reflect the new URL.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">25OCT04</font>
- Changed the ARES NET page to
reflect the changes to the ARES net regarding IRLP connections. Updated
the
MEETINGS page to reflect the past ARES meeting, and revised the RECORD
page to
include the latest call out by the OPP for the Black Bay Area Search.
Also
included the Beachburg Bike Tour ARES exercise. The ARES calendar was
also
updated. The link to the Pembroke Police Services web site was also
revised to
reflect the new web page.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">13OCT04</font>
- Updated the event calendar and
revised the ARES welcome page. Made a slight modification to the ARES
Net
Control schedule.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">26JUL04</font>
- Removed the links to 'It's a
Country Life' from both the navigation bar and the scanner page.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">17JUL04</font>
- Repaired issues with the audio
server for both the country music and the scanner. Looks like the
system is back
up and running the way it should be. Also note that severe storm
activity in the
area has kept the Echo-Link and audio server down randomly in the last
while.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">07JUL04</font>
- Updated the ARES net schedule to
reflect net controller for the next segment.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">24JUN04</font>
- Posted the pictures of
PADDLEQUEST 2004 under 'For The Record. Also added the Canadian Coast
Guard
Auxiliary web site to the navigation bar. Updated the
'Meetings'&nbsp; section
as required. Posted the latest winning picture for the Renfrew County
page.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">09JUN04</font>
- Updated the navigation bar to
reflect the new ARES Ontario page under ARES ONTARIO. </p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">03JUN04</font>
- Video issues appear to have been
worked out. The video feed is now running 24/7 but is only accessible
to family.
The audio card issues have also been resolved, however, there was no
work-around
with the current BIOS in the system. The on-board audio had to be
disabled and
two PCI audio cards had to be added. This works well, and allows
Echo-link to
run 24/7 along with the other audio feeds. The current system is
running on
147.480 simplex with a 100 Hz tone. All are welcome to use the system
while in
the Pembroke and surrounding area.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">24MAY04</font>
- The Scanner and the country
music feed have been running the last 72 hours with no problems. A
slight glitch
in the video feed is causing some trouble on occasion, but hopefully
this will
get worked out soon. The video feed freezes and no update is fed to the
internet. This appears to be a video card related issue. The second
audio card
(Creative Sound Blaster card) has been added to the system. The card
functions
fine on its own, and the on-board sound system works fine on it's own.
Time
constraints have prevented me from working on combining the two cards
into the
system. I hope to deal with this issue in the near future. The second
audio card
will permit Echo-link to run independently in the background.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">20MAY04</font>
- After many trials and
tribulations with various methods and server options, I was not able to
get my
video server (Not accessible from ARES) to run under Linux the way I
wanted it
to. Combined with this is the fact that ECHO-LINK will not run under
Linux. This
prompted me to return to the dreaded Micro-Soft platform. The P4 - 2.2
GHz
machine is once again pumping out audio from the scanner and other
sources,
playing great country music, and feeding video to a closed web-site.
Some work
is under way to add a 2'nd sound card for the Echo-Link system. If all
goes
well, the server will be up running 24/7. </p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">29APR04 - </font>Added
the results of the ARES
AEC meeting to the MEETINGS page. Also made several enhancements to the
ARES
EVENT calendar. The changes are to the color scheme, and the calendar
now opens
in it's own window, allowing for a larger view. </p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">17APR04 - </font>Added
a second audio to the
stream of the audio server (country music) this is an experimental mode
for the
audio feed using separate ports and allowing the user to select the
stream.</p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">13APR04 - </font>The
scanner audio server is now
running on it's own server (P4 - 2.4 GHz) under Linux Redhat 9.0. </p>







<p align="left"><font size="4">01APR04 - </font>The
'MEETINGS' page was added to
the menu selections allowing for a record of the ARES meetings. An
overview of
the 31MAR04 meeting was also added to the site, selectable from the
MEETINGS
page. </p>

can now get to the ARES site from : <a href="http://www.rc-ares.webhop.net/">www.rc-ares.webhop.net</a>&nbsp;
. Please bookmark this new address. (Just think of it as a short
version of
Renfrew County ARES = rc-ares). Also added the ARES ONTARIO link and
updated
some events on the calendar.</p>







<p align="left"><b>10JUN03</b> - Made an early
afternoon desperate plea to my
server support group to PLEASE give me back my CGI scripting... they
responded
within minutes of my email (WOW, now that IS service) and not only did
they
return my directories to CGI compatibilities, but they gave me a hec of
a deal
on my next years subscription. Those guys at Blacksun.ca are GREAT.
Spent the
rest of the evening re-writing my directories on the server (yes, once
again)
but now have control of the way things run. Created a web calendar to
highlight
ARES activities (thanks to a little bit of PERL scripting and some
pre-written
software ). Added this page, and promised Val I would get back to my
regular
duties before much longer...</p>







<p align="left"><b>09JUN03</b> - Have been
battling for control of the software
all evening.... Give me back my CGI-Scripting....Completely re-wrote
several
directories on the server to accommodate the different software, and I
am STILL
doing battle. Thinking I will be begging my server support people to
return me
to CGI.&nbsp;</p>







<p align="left"><b>07JUN03 - 08-JUN03</b> -
MAJOR CHANGES in the way the web
pages are accessed. Moved all of the files for the ARES site over from
my home
web site to my commercial web site, (www.technifest.com) allowing an
expansion of an additional 15
MEG's of web space. Fine tuned the ARES question form, revamped the
FORMMAIL
program and evoked a change over to Server Side Extensions from the
usual CGI
scripting. (Here's hoping I will like the new scripting
tools.)&nbsp;</p>







<p align="left"><b>31-MAY03 - 01JUN03</b> -
Created the first version of an ARES
question form (after persuading my server NRTCO to re-adjust my
settings to
allow for FORM-MAIL activation, which they did, thank you) and put some
finishing touches on some of the link pages. Also added the .pdf file
of the
Renfrew County Emergency Plan and how it relates to the Renfrew County
ARES
group through our agreement.</p>







<p align="left"><b>25MAY03</b> - Created the
HTTP buttons to allow links to the
OPP, OSARVA, and Pembroke Police protocols. Included the protocols for
on-line
viewing. Also put a printable version of Chris's (VA3CRL) Radio-Gram on
line.
Added several more ARES forms for viewing and downloading. Initiated a
WEBHOP
server to allow for a more suitable web name
(www.renfrewcountyares.webhop.net)
instead of the old http://www.nrtco.net/~lester/ARES address.</p>







<p align="left"><b>10MAY03 - 11MAY03</b> -
Updated the look of the HTTP buttons
on the link side of the web page. Added in some links to the members
listing
page and created the 'Construction Page' to be tied to some of the
unfinished
pages.</p>







<p align="left"><b>06MAY03</b> - Created some
of the initial web pages such as
the welcome page and a few links. Uploaded them to the www and sent an
email to
Guy asking him to add a link from the RCARC page over to the ARES page
(as the
ARES page has a link to RCARC)</p>







<p align="left"><b>03MAY03</b> - Initiated
plans to create a Renfrew County ARES
web-site, and discussed the possibilities of having it hosted on the
RCARC site.
However, the logistics of doing this (creating a page, having Guy
upload it,
then my viewing it and making subsequent changes) just did not make any
sense.
Decided to host the page on my personal site at NRTCO.</p>







<p align="left"><b>17MAR03</b> - Discussed
initial concept of ARES web-site at
the RCARC general meeting.</p>
