            <h1>Getting Started in Amateur Radio</h1>
            <p>New to ham radio? Here's a deep dive into how to get started, what gear you'll need, and what it's all about—from the first transmission to long-distance contacts around the world.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="intro-section">
            <h2>What is Ham Radio?</h2>
            <p>Amateur radio, or "ham radio," is a hobby that lets you use designated radio frequencies to communicate locally and globally. Whether you're chatting with friends on a local repeater, working DX stations on HF, or experimenting with antennas and digital modes, ham radio is a technical, creative, and social hobby.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bands-section">
            <h2>HF vs. VHF/UHF: What's the Difference?</h2>
            <p><strong>HF (High Frequency)</strong> ranges from 3 to 30 MHz and is where long-distance (DX) communication happens. You'll talk to people across the country or across the world. Bands like 20m, 40m, and 80m are staples of this part of the spectrum.</p>
            <p><strong>VHF (Very High Frequency)</strong> and <strong>UHF (Ultra High Frequency)</strong> cover 30 to 300 MHz and 300 to 3000 MHz respectively. These are typically used for local communication—talking across your town, county, or region. Most new hams start here using a 2m or 70cm handheld or mobile radio and local repeaters.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="antennas-section">
            <h2>Antennas: Your Most Important Investment</h2>
            <p>Good antennas make all the difference. For <strong>VHF/UHF</strong>, a basic quarter-wave vertical antenna is a great start—many handhelds come with a rubber ducky antenna, but upgrading to a mag-mount for your car or a roof-mounted antenna can vastly improve range.</p>
            <p>For <strong>HF</strong>, wire antennas like dipoles or end-fed half-waves are popular and relatively easy to install. A basic 40m dipole will get you on the air with decent performance across several bands with a tuner.</p>
            <p>Remember: the antenna is more important than the radio. Spend your budget accordingly.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="equipment-section">
            <h2>Starter Gear</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Handheld Radio (HT):</strong> Baofeng UV-5R, Yaesu FT-65, or Anytone AT-D878 for VHF/UHF basics.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile/Base Radio:</strong> Yaesu FT-891 or Icom IC-7100 for HF+VHF/UHF capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Antenna:</strong> Diamond X50, a homebrew dipole, or a mobile whip depending on your setup.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuner:</strong> If you're running HF and a non-resonant antenna, a tuner like the LDG Z-100 or MFJ-945E is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="tools-section">
            <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
            <p><strong>NanoVNA:</strong> A compact, affordable antenna analyzer that lets you visualize SWR, impedance, and more across a wide frequency range. Great for tuning antennas and learning how they behave in the real world.</p>
            <p><strong>Coax Cable and Connectors:</strong> Start with decent-quality RG-8X or LMR-240 for short runs. Learn to solder PL-259 connectors or use crimped options with good strain relief.</p>
            <p><strong>Power Supply:</strong> A 12V regulated supply (20A or more for HF) is needed for most base radios. Look for ones from Astron, Samlex, or MFJ.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="operating-section">
            <h2>Getting On the Air</h2>
            <p>Once you’re licensed and have your gear set up, start with local repeaters. Check in to weekly nets—like ours, every Monday at 7:30 PM. Then try simplex on 146.520 MHz to talk direct, no repeater.</p>
            <p>With HF, listen before you transmit. Try calling CQ on 20m or respond to someone else. Use online tools like <a href="https://pskreporter.info/pskmap.html" target="_blank">PSK Reporter</a> or <a href="https://www.reversebeacon.net/" target="_blank">Reverse Beacon Network</a> to see how far your signal travels.</p>

        <section class="learning-section">
            <h2>Keep Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Join your local club (like us!) and participate in nets, tech nights, and field days.</li>
                <li>Explore digital modes like FT8, Winlink, APRS, and DMR.</li>
                <li>Experiment with building antennas, solar-powered stations, or portable field gear.</li>
                <li>Use logging and mapping tools like <a href="https://www.qrz.com/" class="link">QRZ.com</a> or <a href="https://www.hamqth.com/" class="link">HamQTH</a>.</li>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <details>
    <summary>1. What’s the difference between VHF and HF?</summary>
    <p>VHF (Very High Frequency) is great for local communication—think talking across your town or region with repeaters. HF (High Frequency) is where long-distance (DX) communication happens, letting you talk across the country or the world, depending on band conditions and antenna setup.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>2. How far can I talk with a ham radio?</summary>
    <p>It depends on the band, your antenna, and propagation. With VHF, 20-50 km is typical via line of sight or repeater use. With HF, hundreds to thousands of kilometers are common—even global communication is possible with good conditions and modest gear.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>3. Do I need the internet or cell service to use ham radio?</summary>
    <p>Nope! That’s one of the biggest benefits. Ham radio is independent of the internet, phone networks, and commercial infrastructure. That’s why it’s often used in emergencies.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>4. Can I use ham radio for emergencies?</summary>
    <p>Yes—and many hams do. Ham radio is a vital part of emergency communication networks. You can pass traffic, coordinate response, or just check in on others when the grid goes down.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>5. What kind of radio should I start with?</summary>
    <p>Most new hams start with a simple handheld VHF/UHF radio (like the Baofeng UV-5R or Yaesu FT-65). They’re inexpensive, great for learning, and perfect for talking on local repeaters. Later, you might graduate to an HF radio for long-range contacts.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>6. Do I need a license to transmit?</summary>
    <p>Yes. In Canada, the Basic Amateur Certificate is the entry-level license. It lets you transmit on most VHF/UHF bands and many HF bands if you score above 80%. You can listen to any frequency without a license—receiving is always legal.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>7. What kind of antenna do I need?</summary>
    <p>That depends on what you want to do. For VHF/UHF, a simple vertical antenna on your car, roof, or even a magnetic mount on a metal surface works great. For HF, wire antennas like dipoles or end-fed half-waves are cheap, effective, and easy to build.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>8. What’s the deal with all the weird letters (like FT8, SSB, APRS)?</summary>
    <p>Those are modes. FT8 is a digital weak-signal mode, SSB is voice on HF, and APRS is used for sending position and text data over radio. Each mode has its own use case, tools, and community of operators.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>9. What’s the NanoVNA and why do people keep talking about it?</summary>
    <p>The NanoVNA is a compact, affordable tool used to analyze antennas. It helps you check the SWR (how well your antenna matches your radio) and tune antennas for the best performance. It’s a game-changer for new hams building or adjusting antennas.</p>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary>10. How do hams normally use their radios day-to-day?</summary>
    <p>Some chat on local repeaters during commutes. Others do long-range DX hunting on HF. Many get into digital modes, emergency communications, public service events, satellite contacts, or just experimenting with antennas and circuits.</p>
